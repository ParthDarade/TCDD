The Cat and Da Dog 70cm/2m diplexer
A diplexer for 2m and 70 cm amateur bands made especially for handheld yagis.

## How does it work?
A diplexer is just two filters for diffrent frequencies. Like ball valves that prevent water from flowing back. these filters prevent the flow of some frequencies while allowing others.
